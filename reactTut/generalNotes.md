In JavaScript, <span style='color: orange'>target</span> and <span style='color: orange'>currentTarget</span> are properties of the Event object that is passed to event handlers.

<span style='color: orange'>target</span> refers to the element that triggered the event, while <span style='color: orange'>currentTarget</span> refers to the element that the event listener is attached to.

For example, if you have a click event listener attached to a button, and you click on the button, the <span style='color: orange'>target</span> property will refer to the button element, while the <span style='color: orange'>currentTarget</span> property will refer to the element that the event listener is attached to (which could be a parent element of the button).

Here's an example to illustrate the difference:

```HTML 
<div id="parent">
    <button id="child">Click me</button>
</div>
```
```Javascript
const parent = document.querySelector('#parent');
const child = document.querySelector('#child');

parent.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    console.log(event.target); // logs the button element
    console.log(event.currentTarget); // logs the parent element
});

child.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    console.log(event.target); // logs the button element
    console.log(event.currentTarget); // logs the button element
});
```
In the first event listener, the <span style='color: orange'>target</span> property refers to the button element, while the <span style='color: orange'>currentTarget</span> property refers to the parent element. In the second event listener, both <span style='color: orange'>target</span> and <span style='color: orange'>currentTarget</span> refer to the button element, since the event listener is attached directly to the button.
