### bucket

The Storage service allows you to manage your project files. Using the Storage service, you can upload, view, download, and query all your project files.

Files are managed using buckets. Storage buckets are similar to Collections we have in our Databases service. The difference is, buckets also provide more power to decide what kinds of files, what sizes you want to allow in that bucket, whether or not to encrypt the files, scan with antivirus and more.
